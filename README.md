### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Men Vs. Women, what we talk about when we talk about happiness?
+ This project is conducted by [Yang Cai]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] This project is a brief study on the differences between men and women's happy moments. This study used some concepts on text mining, analyzed some basic characteristics, compared several areas based on dictionaries and analyzed sentiments. The results showed that men were easier to feel happy than women, and they focused on different areas when feeling happy: men felt happy when playing games and women felt happy when playing with children. However, both genders felt happy when they are surrounded with family members.
